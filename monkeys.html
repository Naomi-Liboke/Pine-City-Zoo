                    <h3>MONKEYS</h3>
                    <p>Monkeys are primates belonging to the order Primates and are generally divided into two major groups: Old World monkeys (family Cercopithecidae), found in Africa and Asia, and New World monkeys (families such as Cebidae and Atelidae), native to Central and South America. Unlike apes, monkeys usually have tails and are smaller in size. With over 260 known species, monkeys are among the most diverse and widespread primates, 
                        inhabiting a wide range of environments including tropical rainforests, savannahs, mountainous regions, and even urban areas. Old World monkeys, such as baboons and macaques, are typically ground-dwelling or semi-terrestrial, while New World monkeys, such as capuchins and howler monkeys, are mostly arboreal and adapted for life in the treetops.</p>
     <p>All monkeys have several distinctive features, the most notable of which are their prehensile limbs, expressive faces, and high level of intelligence. Most species have grasping hands and feet with opposable thumbs or big toes, enabling them to climb trees, handle food, and use simple tools. Their tails vary in length and function â€” New World monkeys such as spider monkeys possess long, prehensile tails that can grasp branches, while Old World monkeys generally have non-prehensile tails or none at all. 
        Social behavior is a key trait among monkeys, as they live in complex social groups and communicate using vocalizations, facial expressions, body postures, and grooming rituals. Some species, like vervet monkeys, even have alarm calls that distinguish different predators. Monkeys are highly active during the day (diurnal) and are known for their agility, curiosity, and playfulness.</p>
   <p>Monkeys are omnivorous, although most have a diet that is largely plant-based. Their food includes fruits, leaves, seeds, flowers, and tree bark, along with insects, small animals, eggs, and bird chicks when available. In forested areas, they play an important role in seed dispersal, contributing to the health of the ecosystem. Different species have different foraging strategies: while some forage in trees for soft fruits, others dig through the undergrowth or raid human settlements. Their intelligence and dexterity make them adaptable to various environments, 
    though they face threats from habitat destruction, poaching, and illegal pet trade. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect endangered monkey species across the globe.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the monkeys at pen M05, near the tropical forest enclosure and opposite the lemur habitat.</p>
